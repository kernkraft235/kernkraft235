# Summary

Instrumentation and controls technician with Navy nuclear power plant roots and recent hands-on experience building SCADA-style dashboards, historians, and automation around complex industrial equipment. Comfortable in regulated, high-consequence environments; strong at reading P&IDs/schematics, tracing I/O, tuning/monitoring control behavior, and hardening data/OT networks. Experienced supporting operators, maintenance, and engineers with reliable tools, clear documentation, and disciplined change control. Ready to apply PLC/HMI fundamentals, OPC connectivity, and CMMS-driven PM/CM.

## **Skills**

### **Automation**
- PLC/HMI fundamentals: read ladder logic and I/O maps; collaborate with controls engineers on Allen-Bradley and GE Fanuc systems.
- SCADA/HMI operations (Wonderware/AVEVA style): alarms, trends, historian, security. 
- Reverse Engineered old Historian deployment to use access data directly to enable modern alerting/monitoring/dashboards/reports without needing expensive AVEVA(WW) licensing. All was done using open-source solutions I assembled into a my own "platform"
- Industrial connectivity: RS232 (Serial), TCP/IP, RF (Lora, Bluetooth, NFC, RFID)
- SCADA subnet hygiene: VLAN segmentation, RBAC, secure access.
- Embedded/edge automation with Raspberry Pi for cost-saving controls and data capture.
- Guardrails and feature layering for safe rollouts that are additive, until reliability is established and original systems have been deprecated officially.

### **Troubleshooting**
- Electrical/mechanical fault isolation using schematics, meters, and logs.
- Calibration and qualification of process tools and instrumentation.
- Data-driven RCA and countermeasure validation.
- System recovery after process interruptions with documented dispositions.

### **Process**
- Industrial utilities fundamentals: steam/condensate, pumps, exchangers, chillers, compressors, vacuum, water systems.
- P&ID reading and cause-and-effect tracing.
- SOP/SWI creation, CMMS-driven PM/CM.
- Structured RCA (5-Why, Ishikawa, FTA).

### **Infrastructure**
- Industrial/OT networking: subnet/VLAN segmentation, firewall rules, ICS cyber hygiene.
- Linux/macOS admin, Docker/Nginx deployments.
- OPC servers/gateways, protocol bridging.
- Secure remote access (Tailscale/zero-trust).

### **Data**
- SQL (PostgreSQL, basic MS SQL) for manufacturing/operations data.
- Historian-style trending and KPI dashboards.
- SPC charting and capability analysis.
- Automated reporting with latency reduction.

### **Nuclear**
- Submarine reactor/steam plant operations.
- Electrical generation/distribution operations, casualty response.
- Radiological controls and safety drills.

### **Quality**
- SOP/SWI authoring, ISO 9001/14001 compliance.
- Calibration program coordination.
- Regulatory documentation support.

### **Development**
- Node.js/Next.js production dashboards.
- REST API integration, CLI utilities.
- Structured data handling (JSON, CSV).
- Operator/engineer-focused UI design.

### **Non-Technical**
- Cross-functional collaboration.
- Technical writing and documentation.
- Vendor/contractor coordination.
- Continuous improvement mindset.

### **AI/ML**
- Anomaly detection on operations data.
- Vector search to surface SOPs/ECOs during live alarms.
- LLM-assisted log summarization and passdowns.
